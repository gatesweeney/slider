For this project, I would like to manufacture, from solid materials, a professional grade camera slider that includes at least one axis of motorized motion through Arduino based controls. As a goal, I would like to include a second axis of control (pan), and write code that can memorize "keyframes" that are set by the user. The user will also be able to set a duration for the slider to execute those keyframes, and ideally will be able to select a level of "smoothness" which I believe can be created with preset algorithms. The overall goal for the study is to learn about milling and other fabrication techniques to create tools and parts that can assist me in the filmmaking process, while continuing to expand my knowledge of electronics and basic programming languages and algorithms.
